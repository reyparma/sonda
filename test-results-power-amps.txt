Speakers
2" 3W,4ohm 1" 3W 4ohom
Same results for both
1.  PAM8403 - distortion at mpc vol 45
2.  PM8406 - same results as PAM8406
3.  Big amp with volume know, needed to put the vol all the way down to handle mpc vol 100

Conclusion:  speakers cannot handle higher power than 3W.  change speakers to higher power.
